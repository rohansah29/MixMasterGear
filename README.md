In this project i have tried to manipulate dom elements, styling using Chakra UI and tried to make website more dynamic and responsive. With my efforts and the technology stack that i have learned till Unit-4 in the Masai School, i am able to design the whole website with some functionalities & features.


# Technology Stack Used ðŸŒŸ
